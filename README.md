# pharo-cli

`pharo-cli` is a command-line Pharo Image manager application written in bash. It lets you download, open, rename (coming soon), duplicate and remove Pharo images for any Pharo version. It keeps the images organized in separate folders. In each folder you will have your Pharo image, the data and the respective vm. By default, the images will be stored in `~/Documents/Pharo/images` but it can be changed. `pharo-cli` also supports fuzzy search for searching between your list of images.

## How to use

You can run `pharo help` and `pharo examples` to have more info of how the tools works.

## Installation

_Automate the cloning of the repository and the update of the PATH variable is missing. It will be added for a next release._

First you need to install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) that `pharo-cli` uses for doing the fuzzy search of the list of images.

After that, you need to clone this repository on `~/.pharo`. You will have as a result the code of this repo here: `~/.pharo/pharo-cli/`. And finally you need to update your `$PATH` variable to point to `~/.pharo/pharo-cli/`. For example in my case I need to add: `export PATH="$PATH:/Users/sebastian/.pharo/pharo-cli/bin/"` to my `.zshrc` file.

Finally, you need to create the folder `~/Documents/PharoImages`. That is the folder in which the images will be stored.

### Using `pi`

[pi](https://github.com/hernanmd/pi) works great in combination with this tool. `pi` is an application for installing packages for Pharo Smalltalk. It is a `pip` like tool in which you can do: `pi install pharo-ai` to install the package into your image.
